Simple git workflow:
====================

1. git status – Make sure your current area is clean.
2. git pull – Get the latest version from the remote. This saves merging
   issues later.
3. Edit your files and make your changes. Remember to run your linter and do
   unit tests!
4. git status – Find all files that are changed. Make sure to watch untracked
   files too!
5. git add [files] – Add the changed files to the staging area.
6. git commit -m "message" – Make your new commit.
7. git push origin [branch-name] – Push your changes up to the remote.
